#
# Unit test for scripts/helm-install-drill.sh's resolve_previous_chart_version()
# — the function that turns "the previous released chart version" into an
# actual version string instead of a hardcoded one. It needs a live registry
# (and, for DRILL_LEG=upgrade end to end, a kind cluster) to run for real, so
# this is the part that can be checked in milliseconds with no cluster or
# network: whether the version-selection ALGORITHM picks the right "previous"
# version across the shapes that actually occur — HEAD already published,
# HEAD ahead of everything published, no prior release at all, and CHART_TAGS
# carrying stray cosign sha256-* tags.
#
# The function is extracted from the shipping drill script (it isn't
# sourceable on its own — the script boots a kind cluster on load) so this
# test cannot pass against a definition it invented — a rename or reformat
# that breaks the extraction fails loudly below rather than silently testing
# nothing.
#
# Ported from TruePPM #3941 (scripts/tests/helm-upgrade-leg-version.test.sh),
# generalized to this template's helm-install-drill.sh/generic version
# strings — same algorithm, same extraction technique.
#
# Run: bash scripts/tests/helm-upgrade-leg-version.test.sh
#
# shellcheck disable=SC2016 # the printf lines in run_case() are deliberately
# single-quoted literals — they compose the GENERATED script run_case() writes
# to a temp file, and must stay unexpanded here so $-references resolve once
# under each case's own env, not once under this file's.
