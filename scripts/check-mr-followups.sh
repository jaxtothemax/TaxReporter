#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/check-mr-followups.sh — an MR that admits a follow-up must name the issue
# that tracks it, and that issue must be open.
#
# Why this exists. Upstream, a post-merge audit of the twenty most recently merged
# MRs found three that said, in their own description, that part of the issue was
# left for "a follow-up" — and no follow-up issue existed for any of them. The
# sentence reads as a plan. With no issue behind it, it is the only record the
# work was owed, and it disappears the moment the MR merges.
#
# The rule: every line of the MR description that says follow-up / deferred / left
# open / out of scope / not yet fixed must carry an issue reference (`#NNN`, or a
# cross-project `group/project#NNN`), and at least one same-project reference on that
# line must be an OPEN issue that this MR does not itself close. Pointing the
# follow-up at the issue being closed is the same hole with extra steps.
#
# Opt-out, per line: `followup-ok` anywhere on the line (e.g. inside an HTML
# comment) for a line that uses the words without owing anything — "deferred
# broadcast via transaction.on_commit()" is not a promise. Like every opt-out in
# this repo it is a rubber stamp; what it removes is the silence.
#
# Code is not scanned: fenced blocks and `inline code` are stripped first.
#
# Input, first that applies:
#   --file <path>                 a description in a local file (hand runs, self-test)
#   GitLab API, CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID + CI_PROJECT_ID set
#                                 fetched at job time, so editing the description and
#                                 retrying the job re-checks the new text (the
#                                 predefined variable is frozen at pipeline creation)
#   CI_MERGE_REQUEST_DESCRIPTION  fallback when the API read fails
#
# Issue state is read from the tracker with no auth header, which works for a public
# project; set MR_FOLLOWUPS_TOKEN (a read_api token, masked CI variable) for a private
# one. An unresolvable lookup fails the job;
# MR_FOLLOWUPS_ALLOW_UNRESOLVED=1 is the explicit escape hatch.
#
# Usage:  scripts/check-mr-followups.sh [--file <path>] | --self-test
# Exit:   0 clean or not an MR pipeline · 1 an untracked follow-up · 2 usage/fetch error
